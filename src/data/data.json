      "text": "Preschool builds the foundations for life-long learning and yet 16% of children in Kenya do not attend preschool. Like five-year-old Evans whose parents live on less than $2 a day in the sprawling informal settlement of Kibera. Evans’ parents are already paying school fees for three older siblings in primary school and cannot afford the fees to send Evans to preschool as well.\nWhen both parents are busy making ends meet, Evans is left with a neighbour. She keeps an eye on him but its easy enough for the inquisitive child to wander off exploring. The risks are numerous to a small child in Kibera. Turning Point’s Preschool provides a safe environment for children like Evans to learn and thrive."

He makes lots of noise with his friends as they play football on the playground. Evans is gaining the foundational knowledge that will help him to do his best in primary school."
