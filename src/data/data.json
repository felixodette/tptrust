Like five-year-old Evans whose parents live on less than $2 a day in the sprawling informal settlement of Kibera. Evans’ parents are already paying school fees for three older siblings in primary school and cannot afford the fees to send Evans to pre-school as well.When both parents are busy making ends meet, Evans is left with a neighbour. She keeps an eye on him but its easy enough for the inquisitive child to wander off exploring. The risks are numerous to a small child in Kibera. Turning Point’s ECD Programme provides a safe environment for children like Evans to learn and thrive."

A year passed and his dreams of becoming an engineer faded into the background.\nMany children in Kibera are unable to attend school due to poverty or poverty related problems.\nThese young people join the already huge unskilled workforce competing for unreliable, low-\npaid work and the cycle of poverty continues. Despite primary education being free in Kenya,\nthe additional costs associated with schooling, such as admission fees, feeding programs, and\neven desks, make it difficult for parents to afford. As a result, children can be found playing in\nthe streets, running errands, caring for their siblings, or collecting recyclable items to sell for\npocket money."

  "tptrustBackground" : "The Turning Point Trust is a UK-registered charity and a registered non-governmental organization(NGO) in Kenya formed in 2003 to serve vulnerable children and families in the Kibera informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya.<br /><br />On the 3rd of March 2003, our founders Jo and Jon Parsons, together with the very first staff members:\nJohn Kariuki, Rev. Shadrack Mulinge and Eunice Mulinge, began Turning Point&#39;s journey of seeking\nvulnerable children. On this day, it all started with a pot of porridge and seven children. Over time, the\nnumbers grew, and they knew those that came daily were those who needed to benefit, hence the need\nto start an education programme for the children to attend.<br /><br />For 20 years, we have helped vulnerable children and their families by running a holistic range of\nprogrammes to achieve our vision of seeing children and families in Kibera achieving their full God-given\npotential.\nThe programmes we offer include, a remedial education programme; a free pre-school and primary\nschool; secondary school support, and a community library.<br /><br />To achieve holistic value, we run a school\nfeeding programme, a discipleship programme, a psychosocial support programme and after-school\nactivities alongside the education programmes.\nOur mission has been to demonstrate God&#39;s heart for the poor by offering programmes that relieve\npoverty, transform lives, and restore hope."
